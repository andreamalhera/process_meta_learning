# Meta-Learning applied to Process Mining

> Application of Meta-learning to recommend a suitable process discovery method that maximizes model quality in four complementary dimensions: fitness, precision, generalization and simplicity. According to our Meta-learning pipeline, it is possible to recommend a discovery method with 76% of accuracy using light-weight meta-features from the Process Mining domain.
